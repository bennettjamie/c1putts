## Recording Tips

1. **Keep camera still** - Use tripod or stable surface
2. **Don't zoom** - We need to train on natural distances
3. **Keep recording** - Don't stop between putts, continuous video is best
4. **Vary your position** - Left side, right side of basket
5. **Include misses!** - We need miss data too
6. **Capture full throw** - From wind-up to disc landing

---

## After Recording

1. Transfer videos to computer
2. We'll extract frames using the tool
3. Upload to Roboflow
4. Label with SAM-assisted Rapid mode

---

## Estimated Total: 30-45 minutes of recording

This will give us ~1000+ frames to label!
